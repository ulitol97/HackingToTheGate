# Hacking to The Gate

Hacking to The Gate intends to serve as a bridge between game and cybersecurity.
To achieve this, it provides a demo example of how a remote terminal can be introduced into a videogame via VNC.

Via this template, any person, teacher or learner, might get some ideas on how to find new ways to gamify the learning process of cybersecurity or even prepare their own exploitable machine and have the game connected to it ;)
